The solution involves ensuring the object is retained as long as it's necessary, either by holding a strong reference to it or by using appropriate design patterns such as delegation or ownership.   Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog (@"MyClass deallocated");
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        // ... use myObject ...
        [myObject retain]; //Added retain to avoid premature release

        // ... additional code ...
        [myObject release]; //Properly release when done
        [myObject release]; //Properly release when done
    }
    return 0;
}
```
By adding a `retain` call and pairing it correctly with `release` call, we ensure the object's lifetime is properly managed, preventing the premature release error.
