In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods in manual memory management.  Specifically, an object might be released prematurely if it's not properly retained by another object that needs it. This can lead to a crash when the released object is accessed, resulting in a segmentation fault or EXC_BAD_ACCESS. This is less common now with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), but it can still happen in legacy code or when interfacing with C/C++ libraries that don't use ARC.
